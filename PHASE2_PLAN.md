## 🎯 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Data Structure Setup
- [ ] Create `data/courses-config.json` - Complete course structure
- [ ] Create `data/roadmap-data.json` - Level progression data
- [ ] Define level types: video, quiz, game, coding, milestone

### Step 2: Roadmap UI System
- [ ] Create `css/roadmap.css` - Candy Crush style roadmap
- [ ] Create `js/roadmap-manager.js` - Roadmap rendering & navigation
- [ ] Implement path visualization (winding road)
- [ ] Add level icons and states (locked, current, completed)
- [ ] Add star ratings (1-3 stars per level)

### Step 3: Level System
- [ ] Create `js/level-manager.js` - Level progression logic
- [ ] Video integration (YouTube embeds)
- [ ] Concept carousel system
- [ ] Quiz system (3-5 questions per level)
- [ ] Coding terminal (Monaco Editor or CodeMirror)
- [ ] Game simulations at levels 5, 10, 15, 20

### Step 4: Celebration System
- [ ] Create `js/celebration.js` - Star shower animations
- [ ] Level completion popup
- [ ] XP gain animation
- [ ] Achievement unlocks

### Step 5: Progress Tracking
- [ ] Save level completion to Firebase
- [ ] Track stars earned per level
- [ ] Calculate course completion percentage
- [ ] Unlock external courses at 25% completion

### Step 6: Course Content
- [ ] Populate all 12 courses with level data
- [ ] Add YouTube video links
- [ ] Create quiz questions
- [ ] Design game simulations
- [ ] Add coding challenges
